# Hallucination Detection Log

This file tracks detected hallucinations from the Medical Q&A Assistant evaluation.

## Detection Criteria

- Specific medication dosages without context
- Overly specific statistics or percentages
- Definitive diagnostic statements
- Specific doctor or researcher names
- Unqualified absolute statements

## Mitigation Strategies Implemented

1. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Encourages step-by-step reasoning
2. **Self-Verification**: Meta-prompting includes accuracy checks
3. **Medical Disclaimers**: All responses include appropriate disclaimers
4. **Uncertainty Expression**: Prompts encourage appropriate caution

## Common Hallucination Patterns Observed

- **Dosage Specificity**: Model tends to provide specific dosages (e.g., "take 500mg") without medical supervision context
- **Statistical Claims**: Generates specific percentages without source attribution
- **Diagnostic Confidence**: May provide overly confident diagnostic suggestions

## Prompt Strategy Effectiveness

- **Zero-shot**: Higher hallucination rate (2/5 average score)
- **Few-shot**: Reduced hallucinations through examples (1/5 average score)
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Best performance with systematic reasoning (1/5 average score)
- **Meta-prompting**: Self-verification catches many potential errors (1/5 average score)
