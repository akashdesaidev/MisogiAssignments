# Real-Life Examples of Supervised Learning:

1. Loan Approval in Banks

Input: Income, credit score, employment history

Output (label): Approve or Reject loan

The model learns from historical data where loan decisions are already labeled.

2. Face Recognition on Smartphones

Input: Image of a person’s face

Output (label): Person's identity (e.g., match or no match)

Trained with labeled images of known faces.


# Real-Life Examples of Unsupervised Learning:

1. Market Segmentation

Grouping customers based on behavior, purchase history, or location

No labels are provided — the model finds natural groupings.

2. Anomaly Detection in Network Security

Identifying unusual patterns in network traffic

The system isn’t told what’s normal or not; it learns by itself and flags outliers.

 # Examples of Labeled and Unlabeled Data (in my own words):
    # Labeled Data Example:

      An Excel sheet where each row has customer information (age, income) and whether they bought a product (Yes or No).

    # Unlabeled Data Example:

      A folder full of customer photos with no names or tags — just raw images.
